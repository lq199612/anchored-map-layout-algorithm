# anchored-map-layout-algorithm
A method of drawing anchored maps for bipartite graphs

the idea about How to decide the order of anchor nodes from the paper ***Drawing Bipartite Graphs as Anchored Maps***， and use Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (this part borrows from network's spring_layout，if you want to kown more , you can see the paper  ***Graph Drawing by Force-directed Placement***) to layout the free node,
